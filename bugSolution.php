The solution is to use PHP's strict comparison operator (`===`) instead of the loose comparison (`==`).  Strict comparison checks both the value and type of the operands. This ensures that '0' (string) and false (boolean) are correctly identified as different, avoiding the unexpected result.  Always prefer strict comparison (`===`) in PHP to avoid ambiguous type juggling behavior.
